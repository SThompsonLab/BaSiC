This is where we describe how to setup and use this software.

More details about what it does and how it does it would be de rigour, also.
  * This software iterates over a set of directories, one for each condition.
  * within each directory, it expects to find 8 image subdirectories, which it iterates over.
  * for each image, it runs lense correction using XXYYZZ.
